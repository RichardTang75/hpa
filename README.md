To build this, SDL (https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php), SDL_Image (https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/), and Boost/functional (http://www.boost.org/) are required. 

This is an (as of yet) unfinished RTS that I created over the summer, aiming to build off of my term project. I also used this as a tool to learn C++. It implements terrain generation and one level of hierarchical pathfinding. The relevant parts for hierarchical pathfinding are in pathfinding.cpp and hierarchical_pathfinding.cpp.
